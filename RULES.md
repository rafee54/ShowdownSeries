Rules and FAQ for the Showdown Series
===================


These are the official rules for the York Showdown.

----------

Registration 
-------------

#### Player requirements

 - You must have a 'Prime' DotA 2 account (Phone number tied to the account)
 - There are *no* MMR limits for this tournament
 - Your DotA 2 'Pro-Name' must match your name at sign up, along with your team name. 

#### Purchasing tickets

Please purchase a team ticket from [DICE](https://app.dice.fm/event/xedee-the-york-showdown-competitor-pass-17th-mar-james-college-york-tickets). This is one per team, not per university.

Once you have purchased a ticket, please send the confirmation email to Rafee (rjj513@york.ac.uk) along with the qualifier dates your team wants to participate in.

This is so we can organise which players have signed up in which team. As well as contact you if any issues were to occur with your registration.

**Ticket sales close on the 16th February at noon, so we can start organising teams properly**

Online Qualifier Rules
-------------------

The qualifiers for the York Showdown are being held on 17th of February 2018 and 24th of February 2018. These are the rules for the online portion only, unless otherwise stated.


#### On the day

We will be starting at 12pm on each day. This time will be when all teams have to start getting on with the qualifiers. We expect teams to be prompt to the event and start of matches. Please make sure that your team is ready before the starting time, so we can get on with the games. 

#### Stand-ins

If on the day of the qualifiers, one of your team mates cannot play, you may use one of your stand-ins. 

You can swap players around between matches if need be. 

#### Format

The format of the qualifiers will be a double elimination with teams randomly seeded. 

The top two at the end of each qualifier will be **invited** to the LAN finals on the 17th March 2018. Your team **does not** have to accept the invite. This is explained in more detail below.

The upper bracket matches will be hosted using the FACEIT system, and the lower bracket games will be hosted manually by admins. 

We will be using **Challonge** to keep track of teams progress.

All games will be played in Captain's mode.
First pick and side will be determined using the coin flip function within the DotA 2 client. This is proven to be a fair way of determining sides. 

#### Behavior in lobby

In the lobby, the only people allowed will be: 

 - The 10 players
 - 1 Admin/FaceIT bot
 - Auhtorised BGL/FragSoc observers (If your game will be streamed)

Whilst in the lobby, please keep chatter to a minimum so the admins can get along with starting your games, and asking any questions that need to be asked.

#### Behavior in game

All chatting is **allowed**.

Excessive bad manners will not be tolerated. This will be enforced by the admins, who will be briefed for what to look out for. If either one of the teams aren't happy with any chat, **they can ask for no all chat.**

Racism, sexism, homophobia and excessive swearing will **not be tolerated**.

#### Pausing during the match

Each team has the right to pause the game for an acceptable duration, if a player announces it at least **three seconds in advance** and calls a valid reason (exception: not necessary, if someone disconnects). 

The game must not be resumed before both teams agree with it. When the number or the duration of breaks becomes too high or long, the **admin in the lobby may force the continuation** of the game. 

#### Invitations

The top two teams from each qualifier will be invited to the LAN finals at the University of York on the 17th March 2018.

A team can reject an invite to the event, if they manage to get into the top four teams. In this case, the team placed below them will be offered. (E.G if 2nd place does not want the invite, then 3rd place will be invited.)

#### Account Switching

Account switching is not allowed in any circumstances. This event will be ticketed in the DotA 2 client, and we will be looking at replays of games to ensure that this does not occur.

LAN Rules
-------------

The LAN final of the York Showdown will be taking place on the University of York campus on the 17th March 2018. The top two teams from each qualifier will be invited to play at the LAN final. 

We cannot stress enough that: **YOU HAVE TO ATTEND THE LAN WITH THE TEAM, AND ROSTER, YOU QUALIFIED WITH.** 

#### On the day

The LAN will be starting early on the morning of the 17th March. We will provide a time to arrive closer to the event.

We will have a list of the teams and players to ensure that everyone who should be there, is there.

#### Spectator rules

There is going to be a separate area for spectators to watch the matches on to avoid any distractions for the players.

At the venue, we ask to keep the swearing to a minimum. 


#### Format

We will be continuing the double elimination bracket, so you will know the LAN match ups as soon as the qualifiers are over.

There will be 3 matches at LAN, series is brackets: 

 - Two semifinals (Bo3)
