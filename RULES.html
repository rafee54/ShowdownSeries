<h2 id="online-qualifier-rules">Online Qualifier Rules</h2>

<p>The qualifiers for the Manchester Showdown are being held on the weekend of the 5th and 6th of August 2017. These are the rules for the online portion only, unless otherwise stated.</p>



<h4 id="on-the-day">On the day</h4>

<p>On the day, we will make sure that all players in teams have checked in with their confirmation code they received with their ticket order. </p>

<p>An exact time will be published closer to the time of the qualifiers, this time will be when all teams have to start getting on with the qualifiers. We expect teams to be prompt to the event and start of matches.</p>

<h4 id="format">Format</h4>

<p>The format of the qualifiers will be a double elimination with teams randomly seeded. </p>

<p>The top four at the end of the weekend will be <strong>invited</strong> to the LAN finals on the 18th August 2017. Your team <strong>does not</strong> have to accept the invite. This is explained in more detail below.</p>

<p>We will be using <strong>Challonge</strong> to keep track of teams progress.</p>



<h4 id="behavior-in-lobby">Behavior in lobby</h4>

<p>In the lobby, the only people allowed will be: </p>

<ul>
<li>The 10 players</li>
<li>1 Admin</li>
<li>Auhtorised BGL observers (If your game will be streamed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst in the lobby, please keep chatter to a minimum so the admins can get along with starting your games, and asking any questions that need to be asked.</p>



<h4 id="behavior-in-game">Behavior in game</h4>

<p>All chatting is <strong>allowed</strong>.</p>

<p>Excessive bad manners will not be tolerated. This will be enforced by the admins, who will be briefed for what to look out for. If either one of the teams aren’t happy with any chat, <strong>they can ask for no all chat.</strong></p>

<p>Racism, sexism, homophobia and excessive swearing will <strong>not be tolerated</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="pausing-during-the-match">Pausing during the match</h4>

<p>Each team has the right to pause the game for an acceptable duration, if a player announces it at least <strong>three seconds in advance</strong> and calls a valid reason (exception: not necessary, if someone disconnects). </p>

<p>The game must not be resumed before both teams agree with it. When the number or the duration of breaks becomes too high or long, the <strong>admin in the lobby may force the continuation</strong> of the game. </p>



<h4 id="invitations">Invitations</h4>

<p>The top four teams from the qualifier will be invited to the LAN finals at the intu Trafford Centre on the 18th August 2017.</p>

<p>A team can reject an invite to the event, if they manage to get into the top four teams. In this case, the team placed below them will be offered. (E.G if 2nd place does not want the invite, then 5th place will be invited.)</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="lan-rules">LAN Rules</h2>

<p>The LAN final of the Manchester Showdown will be taking place at the intu Trafford Centre on the 18th August 2017. The top four teams from the qualifier will be invited to play at the LAN final. </p>



<h4 id="on-the-day-1">On the day</h4>

<p>The LAN will be starting early on the morning of the 18th August. The Trafford Centre itself will open at 10am, so teams will be required to arrive at the venue as close to that time as they can.</p>

<p>We will have a list of the teams and players to ensure that everyone who should be there, is there.</p>



<h4 id="spectator-rules">Spectator rules</h4>

<p>There is going to be a separate area for spectators to watch the matches on to avoid any distractions for the players.</p>

<p>At the venue, we ask to keep the swearing to a minimum. </p>

<p>On top of this, avoid distracting any members of staff from both GAME and BGL. This includes admins, casters and the staff helping us throughout the day. </p>
